We build wokwi product, using ultrasonic sensor and detect the distance from the object. Whenever distance is less than 100 cms upload the value to the ibm cloud. In recent device events upload the data from wokwi.

But unfortunately, ibm cloud has not let logged in to me. I've tried many attempts to log in. But it cannot accept my request at last. So I tried my best for my level.
